# How to contribute

First of all, happy that you are here on this page and thinking about contributing to the project.

## Development

To contribute to the development of the site, you can initially open an issue on GitHub and report an error or propose a new feature.

If you are willing to develop, there is no mystery, just open a Pull Request following the template.

This website uses [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Vue composition API](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/).

Try to follow the [official style guide for Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) as much as possible.
